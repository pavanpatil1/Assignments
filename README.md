<p>To setup your local machine you need to install some software. i will tell you </p>

<ul>
<li>Composer
</li>

2. if you see<code>composer is not internal or external command</code> in CMD then we need to install composer on your local machine.

3. To install composer simply go to this url https://getcomposer.org/. In download Section you will able to find download links. if you are windows user then download exe file and directly install and if you are using other operating system then you can go with command line installation.

4.After installation you can verify that with <code>composer --version </code> this command.

5. After sucessful installation of composer we need to install <b>Codeception</b> in your local machine. As we know codeception is an testing framework of PHP application. so we need to install that. so for that simply put this command on CMD <br > <code>composer require "codeception/codeception" --dev</code>. &nbsp;&nbsp; See below image you will get an idea about it.

this will sucessfully install codeception in your local machine. After that we need to create project. 

6. So to create a project Run this command <code>php vendor/bin/codecept bootstrap</code>.

<h5>Setup Assignment Repo on Local ‚≠ê<h5>
so your local machine setup sucessfully for codeception. To setup this Assignments repo on your local machine you can clone this just by writing command in your git <code> git clone https://github.com/pavanpatil1/Assignments.git </code> or else you can directly download zip. After downloading of project you will able to see one <code>images</code> folder all the images in this image folder put that all images in <code> _data </code> Folder of tests directory. all Automation files in root directory copy that all files except <code>acceptance.suite.yml</code>.

 <b><h4>How to Run it on Local Machine üåü</h4></b>

  In this we are goining to see how you run this files on your local enviornment. Open command line from your assignment folder. First we need to start the Selenium and web driver. without them we cannot run our files. So to start Selenium open CMD and type <code>java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.12.0.jar</code> this will start your selenium-server on port 4444 by default you can change port also by writing in command.

after that double click on chromedriver exe file that will start your driver directly.

 After that just put this command on CMD <code>php vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance FirstCest.php</code> this will run your first test case. it's start your chrome browser automatically like this...
